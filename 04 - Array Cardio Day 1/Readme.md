Not really much of a guide necessary for this one. The challenge is pretty well documented as far as what's expected from the developer; use builut-in array methods and perform the necessary operations to provide the expectd values. Easy peasy.

If you're unfamiliar with JavaScript array mehtods, Mozilla docs are your friend.

The following built-in Array methods will be utilized to solve this challenge:
- [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- [Array.prototype,reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
- [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Sort)
- [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter)

Woooooo all done with day 4 challenge..!!!
